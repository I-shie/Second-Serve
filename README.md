# Second Serve

***Second Serve*** is a social impact platform committed to tackling food waste and hunger‚Äîone meal at a time. We bridge the gap between restaurants with surplus food and NGOs that serve communities in need.

Through our platform, restaurants can seamlessly list excess food, while NGOs can view, claim, and distribute it efficiently.

Every year, tons of food go to waste while millions go hungry. We believe that with the right technology and community collaboration, this gap can be closed. Second Serve empowers both food providers and social organizations to work hand-in-hand for a more sustainable and compassionate future.
